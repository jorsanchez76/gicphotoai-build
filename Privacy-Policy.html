        <h1>Privacy Policy - GIC Photo AI</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At GIC, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
                <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
                <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information is shared publicly (or kept private), and permanently deleted.</li>
                <li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
                <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h2>
        <p>We are the folks behind GIC Photo AI, an AI-powered photo generation and editing application. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our mobile application (GIC Photo AI for iOS)</li>
            <li>Our AI image generation and editing services</li>
            <li>Our other products, services, and features that are available through our application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our mobile application and other products and services collectively as "Services." Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>

        <h2>Creative Commons Sharealike License</h2>
        <p>We've decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You're more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.</p>

        <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account, such as device ID and login credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you purchase coins or subscriptions, you will provide payment information such as credit card details through our payment providers (Stripe, Google Pay, or RazorPay).</li>
            <li><strong>Content Information:</strong> When you use our AI image generation services, you provide prompts, upload images for editing, and create AI-generated content. We process this information to provide our Services.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications with Us:</strong> You may provide us information when you communicate with our support team, report issues, or provide feedback about our Services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
        <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most mobile applications, we collect information that devices typically make available, such as device type, operating system version, language preference, and the date and time of access.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services, such as which features you use, how many images you generate, and usage patterns. We use this information to provide our Services and improve them.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address for regional service optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Stored Information:</strong> With your permission, we may access photos on your device's camera roll for image editing features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>

        <h3>Purposes for Using Information</h3>
        <p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide our Services – for example, to generate AI images, process image edits, manage your account, and process payments;</li>
            <li>To further develop and improve our Services – for example by training our AI models and adding new features;</li>
            <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services;</li>
            <li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities;</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about our Services, updates, and promotional offers (you can opt out at any time);</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience using our Services and provide AI recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Information</h2>

        <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
        <p>We do not sell our users' private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Service Providers:</strong> We share prompts and images with our AI service providers (such as Replicate, Ideogram, and other AI platforms) to generate and process images as requested by you.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> We share payment information with our payment providers (Stripe, Google Pay, RazorPay) to process transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> We may store your generated images and data in cloud storage services to provide seamless access across sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
        <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as encryption and secure data transmission.</p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system provides you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile app.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete Your Generated Content:</strong> You can delete images and prompts you've created within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Close Your Account:</strong> If you no longer want to use our Services, you can request account deletion through our support team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, including the rights to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>

            <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
            <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
            <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Reach Us</h2>
        <p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned above, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@gic.mx">privacy@gic.mx</a></p>

            <li>Generated images are stored temporarily for your access and may be cached for performance</li>
